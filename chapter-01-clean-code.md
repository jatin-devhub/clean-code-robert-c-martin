# Chapter 1 – Clean Code

## Key Takeaways

### 1. **Clean Code Matters**
- Code is read **much more often** than it's written.
- Clean code improves **maintainability, collaboration, and debugging**.
- Time spent writing clean code pays off in the long run.

### 2. **What is Clean Code?**
Book shares perspective from many well-known developers. Here's my brief. Clean code should be:
- Clean code is simple and direct. It reads like well-written prose(like a poem).
- Clean code is readable and elegant. It makes the reader feel at ease.
- Clean code minimizes the number of entities (classes, methods, variables, etc.).
- Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.

## Characteristics of Clean Code

- **Focused**: Each function, class, or module does one thing and does it well.
- **Readable**: Easy to understand, even for someone unfamiliar with it.
- **Minimal**: Avoids unnecessary abstractions or complexity.
- **Well-structured**: Logical layout, clear separation of concerns.
- **Consistent naming** and formatting.
- **Tested**: Has unit tests that validate behavior.

> Refactor/improve existing code, even slightly, as you work on it.
