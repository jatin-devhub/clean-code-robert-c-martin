# Clean Code â€“ Notes by Jatin Aggarwal

This repository contains my notes and summaries from reading **"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin**.

The goal is to:
- Reinforce my understanding of clean coding principles
- Maintain a structured, version-controlled collection of notes
- Help others who are learning the book too
