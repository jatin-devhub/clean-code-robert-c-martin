# Chapter 2 – Meaningful Names

## How to choose right names

### 1. Use Intention-Revealing Names
- `int d;` → you know nothing about this 
- `int elapsedTimeInDays;` → you know the intention behind this variable name

### 2. Avoid Disinformation
- Avoid misleading names like hp for hypotenuse. It doesn't help. This is a difference between smart and professional programmers

### 3. Make Meaningful Distinctions
- `Product`, `ProductInfo`, `ProductData` – technically these 3 are different but it doesn't mean different

### 4. Use Pronounceable & Searchable Names
- `customerAddress` > `custAddr` - Code is discussed. So make the name pronounceable so that it can be discussed easily

### 5. Be Consistent
- Use a single consistent pattern in the codebase. Eg - Don't mix - get, retrieve, fetch.

### 6. Avoid Encodings
- `strName`, `m_variable` → unnecessary in modern environments

### 7. Prefer Descriptive Over Short
- `getActiveAccounts()` > `get()`

### 8. Use Domain Terminology
- Improves communication with stakeholders

### 9. Use Verbs for Methods, Nouns for Classes/Variables
